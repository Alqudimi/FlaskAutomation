# Computer Vision Processing Platform

## Overview

This is a web-based computer vision processing platform that provides advanced image analysis capabilities through a Flask backend and interactive frontend. The application offers comprehensive tools for feature extraction, image filtering, feature matching, and geometric transformations using OpenCV. Users can upload images, apply various computer vision algorithms, and view processed results in real-time. 

**New Features (Latest Update):**
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple operations simultaneously (multiple features, filters, transformations)
- **Chain Processing**: Sequential application of multiple filters or transformations
- **Mixed Operations**: Combining different types of operations in parallel processing
- **Results Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple processing results with statistics
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-threaded processing for faster execution of complex operations

The platform is designed to support both Arabic and English interfaces, making it accessible for diverse users working with computer vision tasks.

## User Preferences
